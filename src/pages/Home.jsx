                  I am a cooperative education student currently interning at
                  the Computational Intelligence Research Lab and a fourth-year
                  Computer Engineering student at Chiang Mai University.

                  During my third year (second semester), I simulated working in
                  a software house through the Software Engineering course,
                  enrolled in two computer engineering electives ‚Äî Data Mining
                  for Computer Engineering and Modeling and Optimization for Big
                  Data Analytics ‚Äî and developed the topic and concept for my
                  senior project.

                  In my third year (first semester), I was first introduced to
                  the world of Computational Intelligence through the course
                  Introduction to Computational Intelligence for Computer
                  Engineering, where I learned about Neural Networks, Fuzzy
                  Systems, Genetic Algorithms, and Swarm Intelligence. I also
                  served as a Teaching Assistant for the Logic and Digital
                  Circuits Laboratory course, applying the knowledge I had
                  previously learned to help guide students.

                  In my second year, I worked on numerous projects in both
                  hardware and software. I studied Object-Oriented Programming
                  (OOP), which became a core foundation, primarily using Java as
                  it best represents OOP concepts. I also took courses in Data
                  Structures and Algorithms.

                  I became a full-fledged Computer Engineering student at Chiang
                  Mai University. It was a year of major adjustment as I moved
                  far from home and began relying on myself, doing everything
                  independently. As it was my first year, I mainly studied the
                  fundamental courses I had learned in high school, which made
                  the transition smoother. I also worked on projects with
                  friends, learning through trial and error ‚Äî encountering bugs
                  and collaborating with 5‚Äì6 classmates to solve them. Overall,
                  it was a truly rewarding first year.
