The goal is to compare the behavior and responsiveness of the bot under game situations. It is expected that the Fuzzy Logic-based bot will respond more naturally and effectively, creating a more immersive and enjoyable experience for the player.",

The project combined all core OOP principles ‚Äî from designing classes to implementing various methods ‚Äî and was fully developed in Java. As relatively new programmers at the time, we chose a hands-on, collaborative approach: brainstorming together, coding in turns each day, and jointly refining the implementation.",
