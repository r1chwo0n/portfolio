The goal is to compare the behavior and responsiveness of the bot under game situations. It is expected that the Fuzzy Logic-based bot will respond more naturally and effectively, creating a more immersive and enjoyable experience for the player.",

The project combined all core OOP principles — from designing classes to implementing various methods — and was fully developed in Java. As relatively new programmers at the time, we chose a hands-on, collaborative approach: brainstorming together, coding in turns each day, and jointly refining the implementation.",
