          "This project is a single-player game where the player interacts with a bot whose decision-making system is implemented in two versions: Hard-coded Rules and Fuzzy Logic. The goal is to compare the behavior and responsiveness of the bot under game situations. It is expected that the Fuzzy Logic-based bot will respond more naturally and effectively, creating a more immersive and enjoyable experience for the player.",
